//! `_bard/graph/` cluster nodes -- the storage format that replaced an
//! earlier flat one-file-per-entity layout.
//! `synapse-bard sync` writes one node per source folder (a "cluster",
//! boundary chosen by `sync_cmd.zig`'s own shallowest-content-wins walk),
//! carrying a `sources:` manifest -- each member entity's slug plus its
//! real repo-relative path -- instead of a copy of that entity's own
//! frontmatter. `query`/`field`/`search` resolve a slug *through* a
//! cluster's `sources:` to find the real file to read, rather than reading
//! `_bard/graph/{slug}.md` directly the way the earlier flat layout did.
//!
//! `sources:`'s shape is fixed and this module is its only writer, so the
//! parser below is a narrow pattern match on that exact shape, not a
//! general YAML-list-of-mappings parser -- the same "own the whole
//! round-trip, so don't build more than the round-trip needs" reasoning
//! `synapse-bard`'s other adapters already use.
