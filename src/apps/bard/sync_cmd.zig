//! `synapse-bard sync` -- populates `_bard/graph/` from the bible's real
//! source tree. Not `/synapse-init`'s mechanism (checked, not assumed):
//! that command builds the coding graph through LLM judgment, deciding
//! what subsystems exist and authoring summary/crux prose per node. Bard's
//! version is a mechanical transform with no judgment calls.
//!
//! This was rewritten from an earlier flat one-file-per-entity layout to
//! clustering: `_bard/graph/` now holds one
//! node per *cluster* (a source folder), each carrying a `sources:`
//! manifest of its member entities rather than a copy of one entity's own
//! frontmatter -- a flat 53-file `_bard/graph/` wasn't browsable the way
//! Synapse's own code-graph is. See `src/adapters/bard/cluster.zig` for
//! the manifest format.
//!
//! Always a full re-ingest, never incremental: the whole corpus extracts in
//! ~10ms (measured directly), so there's nothing to gain from
//! dirty-tracking complexity -- re-ingesting a few hundred small files
//! is cheaper than the bookkeeping a "what changed" system would cost.
//!
//! `--check` is a dry-run mode answering "would a real `sync` change
//! anything", reusing `bard_adapters.sync_plan.computePlan`
//! -- the exact same clustering/extraction pipeline the write path below
//! uses -- so there is never a second, parallel notion of what `sync` would
//! produce. `--check` never calls `port.write`/`store.delete`; it only
//! reads.
