# Renders every docs/synapse-bard/diagrams/*.mmd to a same-named .png with mermaid-cli, and
# records the source hash so a stale render is a test failure rather than a
# picture that quietly disagrees with the text around it.
#
# Identical to docs/synapse/generate-diagrams.sh -- deliberately a copy, not a
# shared script both projects invoke with a path argument. The mermaid-cli
# pin (below) is a fact about the diagrams a project owns, and two projects'
# diagrams have no reason to move onto a new pin in lockstep.
#
# Usage: generate-diagrams.sh            render every diagram whose source changed
#        generate-diagrams.sh --all      re-render everything, changed or not
#        generate-diagrams.sh --check    exit 1 if any .png is missing or stale
#        generate-diagrams.sh --help
#
# Why a PNG at all, when GitHub renders ```mermaid fences natively: the docs are
# also read in Markview and other plain Markdown viewers, and a fence shows up
# there as a wall of source. A linked image works everywhere.
#
# Why hash the source instead of comparing the .png: mermaid-cli output is not
# byte-reproducible across versions, fonts or platforms, so a byte comparison
# would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the diagram. The recorded
# sha256 of each .mmd answers the only question --check needs to ask -- was this
# .png produced from this source.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - rendered (or, for --check, everything is current)
#   1 - a render failed, npx is missing, or --check found something stale
#   2 - usage error

# The renderer is pinned, and invoked through npx rather than whatever `mmdc`
# happens to be on PATH, because layout is version-dependent in ways that are
# invisible until you look at the picture. mermaid-cli 11.4.2 (bundling mermaid
# 11.6.0) changed how dagre breaks cycles; for synapse-pipeline.mmd -- a graph
# with a genuine cycle, BUILD -> VAULT -> USE -> BUILD -- that reorders the
# subgraphs into an L with a large empty quadrant.
#
# The empty quadrant is the symptom. The reason it matters is that GitHub
# renders a committed .mmd natively in its file view, so each diagram is on
# display here twice: as that native render and as the .png these docs link.
# Those two must agree, or the repo shows a reader two different pictures of the
# same thing. Pinning is what makes the .png reproducible and keeps it matching.
#
# Bisected 2026-08-06 against synapse-pipeline.mmd: 11.3.0 and 11.4.0 lay it out
# as GitHub does, 11.4.2 does not. Worth re-checking when GitHub's own mermaid
# moves on -- at that point the pin should follow it rather than stay put.
